            <p>Kevin Meza is a 33-year-old performer at Disney World, who has been working there for 11 years. 
                He was born in Miami, Florida, and raised in a Mexican-Salvadorian household in Miami. His first 
                language is Spanish and he learned English in school. He started his dancing career after leaving 
                the church, where he was raised and didn’t feel free enough to dance how he wanted. Kevin loves his 
                job at Disney World, as it is mostly stress-free and he gets to perform for a living. He was part of 
                the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser experience, where he helped opened up the venue working with his 
                droid friend, SK-620. This experience has tested his skills and allowed him to be on the cutting edge 
                of entertainment.
                Outside of work, Kevin enjoys playing video games, consuming media like TikTok, spending time in 
                beautiful weather, eating adventurous food, and playing with cats. He also has a passion for photography 
                and loves to take photos of friends, families, and their pets. One of the biggest challenges he faced in 
                life was coming out of the closet, which was a difficult decision for him as he was raised in a church culture. 
                However, he found the courage to leave the church and discover himself, eventually finding his chosen family.
                Kevin mentions that the most successful thing that he has done, and so glad to do, is go back to school! He 
                had felt so much embarrassment about not finishing school and that has followed him all his adult life. 
                Kevin is currently studying Software Development and is so proud of how far he’s come, but he does not 
                have a clear career goal yet. He is still figuring things out, and he is at peace with that. Someone he 
                has always admired and loved is his friend Annie. She has had a big impact on his life, giving him the 
                backbone to stand up for himself. He values passion and a good sense of humor in people and exemplifies 
                that by lifting up others around him with a smile.
